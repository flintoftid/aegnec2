aegnec2 source code
-------------------

The code in the nec2d directory is derived from the code in
nec2_src.tar.Z on The Unofficial Numerical Electromagnetics Code (NEC)
Archives that used to be at http://www.qsl.net/wb6tpu/swindex.html. 
The SOMNEC code is derived from somnec.tar.Z at the same location. 
These codes are in the public domain. The copyright on the modified

LAPACK source code
------------------

The mlapack directory contains a few routines from the LAPACK 3.2.1
mathematics libraries from http://www.netlib.org/lapack which are
built into a mini LAPACK library under certain build options. This is a 
convenience so users are not required to build a full version of LAPACK 
in order to use the BLAS based version of cnec2. These files are 
distributed under their own GPL compatible license - see the file
mlapack/LAPACK_LICENSE.txt in the souce code distribution.
